# Scatternotes

How a note should be created for the command line application?

Name: RandomId + tags .md
Directory: ~/notes

You can create any file in the ~/notes directory.
When the file does not confirm to the naming sceme a random id is generated.

Whether the file confirms to the naming sceme or not it is searched for tags.
The tags are included in the name.


There are many different types of tags:

- Action tags: todo, remind, howto
- Sorting tags: work, personal
- Search tags: anything else ...
